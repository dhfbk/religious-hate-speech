This folder contains the notebooks to run and evaluate baselines and traditional machine learning algorithms using our dataset.

Note. You need to put data in its non-anonymized form on the data/raw/ folder (after rehydrating it using the provided tweet IDs), and specifically:
- dataset-en.tsv: (columns: id, date, level1, level2, level3, level4, level5, text)
- dataset-it.tsv: (columns: id, date, level1, level2, level3, level4, level5, text)

In the notebooks you will also need to change the data paths to your own to run the experiments.
