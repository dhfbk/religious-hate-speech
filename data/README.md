This folder contains the Italian (dataset_it-portion.tsv) and English (dataset_en-portion.tsv) portions of the dataset. We release the dataset in the form of tweet IDs and labels, following Twitter's rules: 

"Academic researchers are permitted to distribute an unlimited number of Tweet IDs and/or User IDs if they are doing so for the purposes of non-commercial research and to validate or replicate previous academic studies. You should not share the entire Tweet text directly. Instead, you can build a list of Tweet IDs and share those. The researchers who you share this set of Tweet IDs with, can then use the Twitter API to hydrate and get the full Tweet objects from the Tweet IDs."
